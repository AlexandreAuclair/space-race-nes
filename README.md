So this is a game I made last year I really got into 6502 assembly and maybe the code is not really polish but it work so...

To build the game just launch the build.bat(windows) or build.sh(linux) 

I can answer question on the code if I see comment (if I am not just talking in the void here)

I am not use to this so if I did thing wrong just point that out it would be appreciated
